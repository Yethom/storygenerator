<h3>Interactive Story Generator for Children</h3>
This is a Python project that generates interactive stories for children using OpenAI's API. The story evolves based on user input, where they can choose between three different options at each step of the story. At the end, an image and an audio file are generated to illustrate the story. Additionally, an HTML file is created that includes the story text, image, and audio.
